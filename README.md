# ASP.NET Core Template
This is a pretty simple template that I use for myself.
Main changes, comparing to default project:
1. Added config to disable https (a lot of hosting providers helps you with https)
2. Add Username field to Register page
3. Add simple Docker file (you can just remove it if not required)
4. Added persistence of user's keys to database (no need to re-login after re-deploy)
5. Implemented fake email sender to have a full auth working by default
6. Added admin role and default admin user

If you need other features - feel free to create an issue in this repository.
